Fix: Didn't always allow access to a post that was supposed to be available
Fix: The subject of email alerts used the incorrect date for the post alert
Enh: Didn't have a default notification type (single post per alert)
Enh: Use WP's time constants (DAY|WEEK|etc_IN_SECONDS)
Enh: The replaceable value !!today!! didn't use the delay value of the post to calculate the date.
