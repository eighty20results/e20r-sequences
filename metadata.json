    "description" : "Creates content drip feeds ('Sequence'). Sequences are groups of posts/pages/CPTs where the content is revealed to members over time. This is a replacement for the PMPro Series 'drip feed content' add-on for Paid Memberships Pro (pmpro-series).<hr/><p>This plugin supports  Paid Memberships Pro, mostly because it started life as a complete rip-off of the PMPro Series plugin from Stranger Studios, LLC. I needed a content drip feed that supported different delay type options, paginated lists of series posts, a way to let a user see an excerpt of the page/post, support a user defined custom post type, etc.</p><p>I have added quite a few features that weren't included in PMPro Series, specifically the ability to:<ol><li>Configure the sort order for the series/sequence</li><li>Show/hide upcoming series/sequence posts</li><li>Show/hide 'You are on day XXX of your membership' notice</li><li>Show 'delay time' as 'days since membership started' or calendar date to end user.</li><li>Admin defined schedule (using WP-Cron) for new content alert emails to users.</li><li>User opt-in for receiving email alerts</li><li>Templated email alerts for new content</li><li>Pagination of sequence lists in sequence page</li><li>[sequence_list] shortcode for paginated sequence list</li><li>Widget containing summary (excerpt) of most recent post in a sequence [***] for the logged in user.</li><li>Allows 'sneak preview' of upcoming posts in the sequence</li><li>A settings metabox to simplify configuration (rather than only use filters)</li><li>Filters to let the admin specify the types of posts/pages to include in a sequence, etc.</li><li>A sequence will 'clean up' after itself (remove itself) from posts that were managed by it.</li></ol></p>",
